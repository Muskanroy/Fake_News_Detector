# Fake_News_Detector
Project idea – Fake news spreads like a wildfire and this is a big issue in this era.

We can learn how to distinguish fake news from a real one. We can use supervised learning to implement a model like this.

Dataset- [Detecting Fake News Dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1er9NJTLUA3qnRuyhfzuN0XUsoIC4a-_q/view)

First we extract the dataset then do preprocessing on the text and then train the ML model(here we use Multinomial 
Naive Bayes Algorithm) for the modelling.
In this project I will be using Multinomial Naïve Bayes since it’s the best one to be implemented in this text
classification task due to its ability to maintain the number of word occurrences in each document. Multinomial Naive 
Bayes algorithm is a probabilistic learning method that is mostly used in Natural Language Processing (NLP). 
The algorithm is based on the Bayes theorem and predicts the tag of a text such as a piece of email or newspaper article.
